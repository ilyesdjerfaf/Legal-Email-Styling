I've attached the prepayment request.  The physical address for the bank is

	Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company
	C/O Bank Of America
	File  #96264
	840 S. Canal Street, 6th Floor
	Chicago, IL  60693

The address of the company we are doing business is 

	Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company
	Nine Greenway Plaza
	Houston, TX  77046

The person I negotiated the deal with is Andy Armstrong, his number is 832-676-5120.
The person at El Paso Corporate Credit (Tennessee is a sub of El Paso) is Julie Baker, her number is 713-420-7446.


Eric,  Julie at El Paso said the only reason she is requiring a prepay for this small an amount is because her records show that ENA has not paid any monies for anything on the El Paso pipelines, including Tennessee, Sonat, ANR, or El Paso Pipeline.  I know that we should have at least paid for the Bear Creek storage on Tennessee."

Sorry... I didn't call last night.

I was working on my September spreadsheet for TCO at home. I was going to
take a break and call you and my parents... but I had to get the spreadsheet
done for the long weekend. I finished it at 1:30 am. Thought this would be
too late to call.

Hopefully the weekend scheduling goes smooth, so I can work on August
Accounting this afternoon. I'm just extemely slow at everything right now.

Let's talk this afternoon.

Please create a manual invoice to MCV for the following item

Delivery Period Mar-02

Contract 96001636
Volume 5000 x 31 days = 155,000
Price  $2.46
Pipeline  PEPL.
Location  Anadarko Pool.


The total amount should be $381,300.00.  Let me know if I missed something.

The Panhandle item for March 2002 is pathed but it's not passing through to settlements.  I'm not sure who to call about this.  

Louis, this is Phil and I have come up with on the A/R balance.  Now this doesn't mean that we have sent out everything - its always possible that an invoice was never created even though everything looks ok in the trading and scheduling systems.  Our March 2002 Panhandle item is a good example.

Amount			Comment		
$1,058,352.31		A/R Balance as of 5/9/02

   $472,171.50		April 2002 activity

     $26,143.85		This is part of the $381,300.00 manual invoice that Max will send out.  I believe MCV has agreed to pay this but only after we bill them.
     $17,942.80		Incorrect pricing for March 2002
   $384,975.00		MCV's replacement cost for MCV II that we did not serve in March 2002.  Ed needs to decide if MCV has the right to do this.  MCV
			support for this and the replacement prices seem reasonable.
   $429,061.65		1 To 30 day outstanding receivables

     $39,694.20		31 to 60 day outstanding receivables.  Pricing discrepancies for Feb 2002 production. We agree with MCV's pricing.

I took the volumes on deal 472520 (CPR Storage) to 0 and moved them to the 
following deals.  
Crystal, deal 472520 was valued at CGLF IF.

Deal  Comment
473178  Exchange sell for the November Injections
473190  Exchange buy for the December withdrawals.

Susan wants the withdrawal volumes to go into Texas Gas.  

Tricia, deal 473190 has the daily withdrawal volumes.  Please set up the Egan 
to Texas Gas ticket.

All of my information is on the following worksheet  
0:/logistics/capacity/east/NE/Egan_strg_NOV2000.xls if any is interested.

Subject: EGAN Storage

We are injecting gas into EGAN storage today through Monday, off of Texas Gas 
and CGLF.  We will be withdrawing this gas ratably in Dec into Texas Gas.  I 
will probably make a mistake or two on my deals because I'm kinda sleepy.

Crystal will help me set up the deals on EGAN.  I am currently using a CPR 
Storage deal ticket and I believe that is incorrect.  I will let everyone 
know the deal tickets by the end of the day."

Ms. Perlingiere:

Gloria Salazar and Greg Hall asked that I let you know that we received the
Gas Purchase Agreement for our PA facility today.  Before it is executed,
Gloria has asked our legal group to review it.  They are doing that now;
however, it will be Monday before she will have their comments.  The plant
in PA will not be ready to sell gas until Tuesday, possibly Wednesday, and
we anticipate that the agreement will be in place by then.  Although Greg
will be out of town next week, Gloria will be able to talk with you.  If you
have questions, please contact her on Monday.

Enron North America Corp. does not cover trades with Enron Canada.  For gas 
delivery in Canada, you should consider an agreement with Enron Canada.  

Also,  for long term firm transactions with ENA, you should have a Master 
Agreement.  I hope this clears up any confusion.  If not, please give me a

Subject: Opportunities at ENA



Michelle, per my voicemail as I indicated, I am trying to pursue what
opportunities may be available at EWS and both Julia Murray and Kay Mann
recommended that I contact you.  As background, I have been at EECC since
October last year where I have focused on traditional EPC contracts and
joint venture agreements with construction partners, cross-border financing
agreements principally in Mexico and merger and acquisition/strategic
investment transactions.  Before coming to Enron, I worked with the Houston
office of a New York based firm (Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle)
where I focused mostly on transactions in Mexico since we represented Pemex
on their transactions involving long and short term oil supply agreements
and CFE (Mexico's electricity commission) on its public bids for EPC and
IPP projects.  Lastly, I started my legal career in 1994 at Patton Boggs in
Washington, DC where I focused on general domestic corporate transactions
such as establishing new business entities (ie, joint venture work,
partnerships etc.), m & a work, and securities offerings.  Thanks for your
consideration and I look forward to talking with you when you return from
vacation (my extension is 6-6127).

kay.mann@enron.com,"Team,

I still need comments on the GE break out contract which was previously 
forwarded to Finance, Accounting and Tax. If anyone who didn't get it would 
like to get it, please let me know.  

Also, I am unclear as to whether the consent form we received earlier this 
week is the final version from Enron's standpoint.  Any information on that 
point would be appreciated.

Thanks,

Subject: Final Doc Run + Due Diligence for Closing

Ok Team, we are in the last throws of documentation of financing documents!  
They will be done by noon.  If anyone has comments, they need to be in before 
that.  I also want to receive written confirmation from Accounting, Tax, ENA 
Legal, EGF Legal that they have signed off on the documents.   The only 
document left outstanding which the legal team is busily working on for 
completion [today hopefully?] is the EPC Contract.

Starting on Monday, the legal team needs to begin the closing due diligence 
process.  Given that we thought we had a great call with GE this week and got 
at least S&S's signoff on consent letter, we haven't heard from anyone.  This 
is UNACCEPTABLE since it puts not just TurboPark but all the deals relying on 
TurboPark in jeopardy!

I will arrange a meeting on Monday to walk through the closing checklist with 
the legal team to insure that everything can be completed by December 13th.

CLOSING WILL OCCUR ON DECEMBER 15TH!

Happy Holidays,
Lisa"

We won't have any site specific technical info, so we will  have to fly 
without it.  I know that seems strange, but there is no designated site for 
this equipment as of now.

Here's co#1:



Each of these units has one dual fuel option.

The master list of serial numbers is in this document:




We use the unit serial numbers as opposed to turbine or generator serial 
numbers.  I'm sending you the whole enchilada since this is a handy reference.

I agree with adding 25% of the cost of the dual fuel option to the January 
payment.  Unit 17  to company 1 is fine.  The maximum liability price (or 
whatever we call it) will be the base price allocation, plus the dual fuel 
option amount.

Good question on the retention.  I guess we should set it up as if each is in 
a stand alone project. As far as I know they may be intending to put these at 
separate sites.

I'll get back to you on the fax and contract reference number.

According to Illinois counsel, there is no quirk in Illinois law that 
mitigates against being able to enforce a contract with a party who signs the 
contract under a registered d/b/a name.   Since we have a copy of the 
company's d/b/a filing certified by the Illinois Secretary of State, we 
should already have everything we need.   In an abundance of caution, we 
could ask the counterparty's corporate secretary to certify that ""[actual

mitigates against being able to enforce a contract with a party who signs the 
contract under a registered d/b/a name.   Since we have a copy of the 
company's d/b/a filing certified by the Illinois Secretary of State, we 
should already have everything we need.   In an abundance of caution, we 
could ask the counterparty's corporate secretary to certify that ""[actual 
corporate name]"" and ""[d/b/a name]"" are one and the same entity.  But I 
personally think even doing that is overkill -- the Illinois Secretary of 
State is already basically telling us that in the certificate we already have 
in the file.

Feel free to call w/ any comments or questions.

According to Bill, Mr. Archietzel stated in his speech that he believes it

than the enumerated grains and meats) in the CFMA when establishing which 
commodities will continue to be subject to full regulation.  Mr. Archietzel

robert.bruce@enron.com,"Sara and I were told this morning, by our London office, that the MG 
acquisition has closed.  Based on what we have heard about MG's New York 
activities, that may mean that Enron is now the owner of some 
CFTC/NFA-licensees (such as FCM's, CTA's, pool operators, etc.).

I realize we may well not have acquired the domestic businesses to which I am 
referring, and if we have, someone may already be addressing this.

robert.bruce@enron.com,"Sara, I think the credit issues that I was going to have to address with 
Russell have been resolved in that it looks like Russell is just going to do 
a margin call on this counterparty (North Coast Energy).  However, I think 
these issues could come up again with other counterparties, and I think it 
might be beneficial to have a general meeting with credit to establish some 
guidelines (especially since there are so many new people in credit).

The issue, basically, is alternative ways of gaining comfort if we want to 
forego a margin call -- the North Coast situation is a good example.   North 
Coast started as a simple ISDA amendment to raise the collateral threshold so 
that we wouldn't have to margin call.  Russell (as he has on another deal) 
asked to provide that North Coast's substantial debt to its parent company be 
subordinated to us.  As we were considering this arrangement, North Coast's 
counsel called to tell us that they had just signed up a big bank line that 
they used to pay off the intercompany debt.  He told us that the bank 
syndicate had also agreed, essentially, to let Enron share secured creditor 
status with the bank group -- on the same debt priority level -- for up to $5 
million on a pari passu basis.  But I think Russell felt that North Coast had 
gotten over leveraged, and so it looks like he's going to do a margin call.

I have tried to impress upon Russell that gaining debt priority -- whether 
through an intercompany subordination agreement or pursuant to an arrangement 
described above -- is not a simple thing to effect legally.  Obviously, on 
this particular deal, we've got too much on our plates in-house to spend time 
reviewing the 82-page loan agreement, negotiating intercreditor documents, 
and doing due diligence on the liens.   I did tell Russell that if North 
Coast was willing to pay for outside counsel to do this for us, then I would 
have to ask you or Mark Taylor if we could go this route (we never made this 
offer to the counterparty).

It seems to me that there is a lot of potential for these situations to come 
up again.  I would think that the rise in gas prices has resulted in a lot of 
exposures, and for business relationship purposes, we like to consider 
alternatives to margin call if the counterparty can come up with another way 
to give us comfort (this afternoon I got a call from one of our marketers who 
was rather irate about the North Coast margin call).  If we are going to be 
considering alternatives like subordination or secured creditor status, I 
think it would be a good idea if we impressed upon everybody in credit that 
these arrangements are not achieved as easily as they are conceived, and that 
they will have to engage in a bit of cost-benefit analysis, and consider the 
logistics involved, before agreeing to these arrangements.

Let me know what you think. -- Bob

retains a veto, which has rarely if ever been exercised.  Once we have 
retained counsel we will use that counsel on other regulatory projects unless

You should be receiving today a copy of my draft budget proposed for Enron 
Europe for 2001.  I understand from Nick that they are doing their own budget 
for Enron Japan, which I will see only after the fact.

MOST IMPORTANTLY, you will see that I am budgetting to pay a substantial sum 
for legal fees.  I will be proposing to John Sherriff, Michael Brown (our new 
COO and former General Counsel, which will make my proposal doubly 
problematic), and to Mark Evans (current General Counsel) that I pay/manage 
our outside regulatory counsel.  We can discuss (rather than do a lengthy 
e-mail), but having this function managed by Legal (and Houston/Jim Derrick 
rejecting our choice of counsel in important cases), is increasingly a 
problem.  I believe this will mirror what you do in the USA, e.g., Dan 
Watkiss, and hope that I can count on your support for this change.  thansk

Ken Lay Visit. Following discussions with the Prime Minister's office and a 
quick check with venues 31 October is firming up as the preferred date for a 
meeting with the Prime Minister and an office opening by the PM. 

Jeff Skilling Visit. The Nikkei and the Tokyo University have now made the 
decision to invite Mr Skilling to give the key note address at the symposium 
on 26 November in Tokyo. As mentioned, the symposium is the most prestigious 
conference on IT in Japan.

While the conference itself receives significant media attention, the 
President of Nikkei has offered to interview Mr Skilling. This honour is 
usually reserved for Heads of State. The interview will be featured on the 
front page of the Nikkei and picked up by other major media services.

Subject: Re: Ken Lay meeting with Japanese Prime Minister  

Ken Lay Visit. Balancing the need to push out the arrangement of high level 
meetings as far as possible with the desire to have a meeting with Prime 
Minister Mori prior to the US Presidential election, the week commencing 30 
October would be the optimum time for a visit by Mr Lay. PM Mori is generally 
available in that week. We will get a preferred time from the PM's chief 
secretary first thing tomorrow morning Tokyo time. 

Jeff Skilling Visit. The boards of Nikkei and Tokyo University Institute of 
Advanced Studies have yet to make a decision on the key note speaker for the 
one day invitation only seminar to be held on 26 October. As mentioned, the 
boards will choose between the chairman of Cisco and Jeff Skilling. The 
conference is focused on the IT revolution and an invitation only event for 
approximately 600 of Japan's corporate leaders.

The speaking panel and topics for discussion will be developed around the key 
note speaker. If Mr Skilling were to give the key note speech, it is likely 
that key senior Government Ministers would be asked to present at the 
seminar. 

Following the Prime Minister's commitment at the Okinawa summit of 
US$15billion expenditure in the region on IT infrastructure and education, 
Japan's focus on e-commerce is almost reaching fever pitch. There will be 
significant interest in the conference from senior levels of Government and 
the business community. Further, as you would expect with the involvement of 
the Nikkei, there is typically significant media coverage associated with the 
key note speaker's presentation.
