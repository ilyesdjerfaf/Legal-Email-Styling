AMPO-1, Feb 23, 1994), senior management officials, testified concerning AEP\\'s =0F, - 2 - alleged discriminatory practices. 1/ AMP-Ohio association municipalities Ohio, whose members depend AEP transmission partial requirements service.= =20 IMPA association municipalities Indiana, many IMPA\\'s loads captive AEP transmission system. witnesses alleged follows:=20 1. anticipation high peak demands, AEP would contract large blocks available short-term power, withhold sale short-term power, refuse transmit third party short-term power, require purchases AEP emergency rate (100 mill/kwh) emergency might exist. Ex. AMPO-1 6. 2. December 1989, AMP-Ohio negotiated 20 MW purchase short-term power Louisville Gas & Electric Company (LG&E). AEP refused wheel LG&E earlier day told AEP power sell AEP.=20 AEP bought power LG&E offered resell AMP-Ohio. Ex. AMPO-1 6-7. 3. January 1990, AMP-Ohio solicited bids February power purchases number utilities including AEP. AEP winning bid. AMP-Ohio made arrangements purchase power four winning bidders sought transmission AEP. AMP-Ohio gave AEP =20 1/ Rehearing Order expanding scope proceeding, AMP-Ohio IMPA withdrew testimony longer necessary. withdrawal change fact testimony sworn oath. =0F, - 3 - schedule delivery, AEP refused transmit power, matched average price winning bids, made sale itself. Ex. AMPO-1 7. 4. August 1993, AMP-Ohio member (Columbus, Ohio) purchasing 10 MW hourly non-displacement power AEP and, AEP raised price 60 mills/kwh, sought another source next hour. Consumers Power Company Detroit Edison Company offered non-displacement power 40 mills. AEP refused transmit, saying 600 MW unit could resell power another source. 2/ Columbus cancelled transaction buy 10 MW power AEP 100 mills/kwh. Ex. AMPO-1 7-8. 5. July 1993, two AMP-Ohio members (Columbus St. Mary\\'s) buying hourly non-displacement power AEP price rose 35 mills. Dayton Power & Light Company (DP&L) offered sell 23 mills AEP agreed transmit one hour. next hour, AEP said problems system, refused transmit power, kept power DP&L offered sell power AMP-Ohio Columbus St. Mary\\'s 100 =20 2/ AEP generally limited offer short-term transmission buy/sell transactions; is, AEP would buy power seller resell purchaser.=20 Supplemental testimony AEP Witness Baker (Ex. A-73) 27-29. Often, terms buy/sell transaction required transmission dependent utilities (TDUs) maintain reserves meet contractual commitments least year. Id. =20 =0F, - 4 - mills. Columbus increased local generation, St. Mary\\'s purchased 8 MW 100 mills. next hour, AMP- Ohio arranged DP&L another 8 MW, hoping AEP would transmit 24 hour buy-sell agreement. AEP transmit power. Seven hours later day, St. Mary\\'s Greenup Hydro project power available 8 MW DP&L longer needed. St. Mary\\'s receiving hourly power AEP refused transmit, St. Mary\\'s could switched Greenup power. AMP-Ohio changed daily service, St. Mary\\'s pay demand charge entire day, even though used power 7 hours would paid less hourly rate. Ex. AMPO-1 8-9.=20 6. January 1994, AMP-Ohio sought transfer power one member generation members, required transmission AEP Toledo Edison lines.=20 Toledo Edison said yes, AEP said no. AMP-Ohio\\'s northern members purchased emergency power Toledo Edison. AMP- Ohio reminded AEP agreed deny transmission AEP agreed transmit. Ex. AMPO-1 9. = =20 7. IMPA arranged buy 80 MW short-term power LG&E wheeled, using buy-sell arrangements, Public Service Company Indiana (PSI) AEP serve IMPA\\'s load Richmond (an IMPA member). delivered price $.292 per kW-day plus 1 mill adder.=20 time AEP arranged buy 300 MW PSI $.30 =0F, - 5 - per kW day plus out-of-pocket energy costs. Hence, PSI shipping total 380 MW AEP 80 MW amount delivered IMPA\\'s load Richmond. Then, day IMPA received 80 MW, AEP told IMPA PSI sold everything AEP IMPA would buy AEP $.63 per kW day plus cost energy AEP. IMPA purchased AEP protest. AEP used control transmission intercept 80 MW lower price resell short-term power IMPA. AEP claimed PSI terminated sales AEP day. 80 MW independent PSI\\'s sales AEP would interrupted AEP interrupted it. IMPA-1 7. 8. IMPA combustion turbines owned located one member, IMPA would like connect Joint Transmission System owned IMPA, CINergy Wabash Valley Power Association. so, IMPA needed metering agreement AEP, AEP would agree. IMPA-1 6. 9. January 1994, IMPA power sell turbines AEP others needed power. IMPA offered power AEP AEP said could purchase power without existing contract. Moreover, since short-term tariff, IMPA could sell power another utility. IMPA-1 6. =20 10. Another example utility engaging =0F, - 6 - dilatory tactics raised customer\\'s transaction costs effectively denied transmission \"sham transaction\" provision proposed AEP. filed, AEP\\'s tariffs permitted deny service merely portion transmitted power might used serve former retail customer AEP. See, e.g., Ex. BR&WVP-1 (J. Bertram Solomon testimony, February 23, 1994). (As part settlement AEP filed pro forma tariff withdrew provision.)=20 11. Finally, AEP\\'s originally filed tariff contained \"prodigal customer\" provision. provision, transmission customers sought convert back requirements service give AEP five years\\' notice, case AEP customer would enter negotiations determine whether AEP provide service rate, terms, conditions.=20 Ex. S-39 1 (Staff testimony). AEP require notice new customers, prodigal customers. Id. 2. potential customer previously served AEP reason treat customer differently. (AEP withdrew provision filed pro forma tariff.) B. Entergy Services, Inc. (Entergy)=20 Entergy filed partial settlement largely adopting NOPR pro forma tariffs except two provisions (headroom ancillary services). settlement predated filing date customer testimony ALJ, customers =0F, - 7 - address need Entergy file tariff. However, customers make allegations discriminatory practices, follows. =20 1. Customers alleged Entergy flat-out refused wheel. Louisiana Energy Power Authority (LEPA) witness Sylvan J. Richard testified LEPA\\'s predecessor systems could obtain interconnections Entergy. Ex. SJR-1 50. 2. Customers also alleged Entergy refused provide service priority equal native load refused provide service flexibility equivalent utility\\'s use. example, LEPA witness Richard testified even state commissions ordered interconnections coordination services, LEPA\\'s predecessors still able obtain coordination services Entergy willing coordinate transmission service offer inflexible, unidirectional point-to-point service, prevented economic coordination others.= =20 Id. 50-51. =20 3. South Mississippi Electric Power Association (SMEPA) witness J. Bertram Solomon testified Entergy\\'s original \"open access\" tariff restricted point-to- point service, proposed separate charges operating company, required cancellation existing agreements order take service proposed tariff. Ex. SMEPA-10 28. Entergy eventually filed =0F, - 8 - network tariff, proposed different local facilities charges various Entergy public utility operating subsidiaries. Id. 29. Since local facilities charges higher transmission component subsidiaries\\' bundled rates, Entergy obtained competitive advantage. Id. 4. Arkansas Cities Cooperatives (ACC) group cities cooperatives operate electric generation distribution systems Arkansas.=20 ACC Witness Steven Merchant testified Entergy segregated wholesale market two subsidiaries, Arkansas Power & Light Copmpany (APL) Entergy Power, Inc. (EPI). Ex. SMM-1 16. marketing power energy Arkansas, EPI subject Arkansas Commission order bars EPI competing APL wholesale loads without first obtaining waiver. Id.=20 Recently, EPI requested waiver wholesale transactions Arkansas except wholesale customers currently served Entergy subsidiary; words, EPI requested Arkansas Commission expand competition wholesale customers except EPI might compete APL. Id. ACC witness Merchant concluded that, since EPI compete APL, Entergy insulates APL\\'s wholesale business competition denies wholesale customers access EPI source power, thereby limiting alternative generation sources available =0F, - 9 - ACC. Id. 17-19. (Entergy\\'s witness Kenney stated Entergy recently filed joint motion ACC Arkansas Commission seeking extend waiver permit EPI sell APL\\'s wholesale customers. Ex. JFK-11 14- 15.) C. Pacific Gas & Electric Company (PG&E) Northern California Power Agency (NCPA) attached several documents 1988 complaint Docket No. EL89-4. documents provided support NCPA\\'s claim PG&E\\'s unreasonable practices PG&E/NCPA Interconnection Agreement (IA) effectively denied NCPA access transmission properly requested IA. Although parties eventually settled Commission terminated docket letter order dated May 18, 1988, documents provide allegations PG&E using dilatory tactics protracted negotiations effectively equal refusal wheel. 3/ =20 1. PG&E stated since transmission currently available, entitled wait 72 months providing transmission; is, transmission access could granted passing 72-month notice period. NCPA 1988 Complaint, Ex. 3.

However, incidents exactly incidents described NOPR, NCPA one owners COTP. =0F, - 10 - provided transmission provided becomes actually available. PG&E also requested substantial additional information, NCPA considered beyond reasonably necessary study, still provided. PG&E determined transmission available, reasoning transmission unavailable unless transmission requested could provided 8760 hours per year without restrictions limitations, extending expiration agreement 2013. NCPA 1988 Complaint 9. =20 2. November 27, 1987, NCPA made new transmission request PG&E, seeking 50 MW bi-directional transmission Midway. NCPA 1988 Complaint, Ex. 5.

Nowadays people know price everything value nothing. - Oscar Wilde Certainly consumers policymakers understand value renewable energy products - products avoid acid rain, smog, global warming, soot pollution caused mainly coal-burning power plants. Perhaps removal stranded cost charges consumers\\' bills next year, Duquesne Light service territory first market price value renewable energy understood motivate large numbers customers buy (see case studies follow). Moreover, new study published August 24, 2001 edition Science, Mark Z. Jacobson Gilbert M. Masters Department Civil Environmental Engineering Stanford University, shows \"cost gap\" coal power cheapest forms renewable energy narrowing sharply, 0.5 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh). importantly, professors Jacobson Masters document apparently slightly lower cost coal generation illusion reality, due real costs. coal generation\\'s environmental health costs like damage air, water forests, well human illness death, included calculation, coal generation\\'s real price jumps 5.5 cents 8.3 cents per kWh. comparison, 4.0 cents 5.0 cents cost wind energy makes bargain. \"Wind energy unequivocally less expensive coal energy,\" say Jacobson Masters. Much Kilowatt-Hour? surprising know value renewable energy products electricity markets many real pollution costs burning fossil fuels included price electricity many consumers still know link electricity generation environmental health damage. Yet lack knowledge goes beyond value electricity markets. Consumer inexperience markets complex transition competition make electricity exception rule people know price everything. Even sophisticated observers know price comparative products, regardless added environmental public health costs. Price transparency bad joke, stranded cost charges make understanding price easy getting clear view smoggy day Houston. states allow customers choose generation supplier, consumers policymakers know local utility charged generation prior competition, including called stranded costs. Perhaps even fewer know prices alone, including stranded cost charges, today\\'s competitive products compare utilities\\' unbundled generation rates charged prior competition. today\\'s renewable energy prices compare utilities\\' pre-competition generation rates. many know today\\'s price compare default rate compares pre-competition, monopoly generation rate (which includes stranded costs)? Confusion basic questions widespread distorts perception policy. vital policymakers know answers order formulate wise policy (see answers, \"It\\'s Numbers,\" E3, Vol. 3 No. 12). even that\\'s foundation perhaps much tougher question electricity: \"What worth?\" important change affect answer horizon. Beginning February, 2002, stranded cost charges eliminated electric bills Pittsburgh area. payments made Duquesne, primarily cover prior investments uneconomic, nuclear generation, recovered consumers Competitive Transition Charge (CTC). following examples typical types customer bills Duquesne Light territory illustrate comparative prices pre-restructuring present default rates, new default rates take effect next year, various renewable energy products. examples hopefully clear away haze surrounding true price renewable products. Residential Customers typical residential customer (rate RS) using 600 kWh per month paying Duquesne Light $75 per month since rates capped 1996. monthly $75 bill, $48 total generation costs rest distribution services. turn, $20 $48 total generation cost reflects stranded cost charges. Since customer choice began, 600 kWh residential customers - including choosing competitive supplier - pay Duquesne $20 stranded costs. customers required pay Duquesne stranded costs, typical customer\\'s total bill would less $55, whopping 27 percent less now. result stranded cost charges, customers choosing competitive supplier avoid paying Duquesne $28 $48 generation rate, $28 reflects \"shopping credit\" price compare available. So, customer could buy 600 kWh per month less $28, including transmission, would s/he save money switching competitive supplier. see, stranded cost charges weird economics pricing produce make difficult know price electricity, let alone value renewable generation. typical residential consumer purchased renewable generation today 6.0 cents/kWh, consumer would pay $36 generation - $12 per month less historic regulated generation rate $48. rate 7.0 cents/kWh, consumer would pay $42 renewable generation, $6 per month less. price renewable generation must 8.0 cents/kWh consumer pay residential consumers paid regulated utility mostly coal nuclear power. presently four competitive suppliers offering five renewable energy products Duquesne\\'s territory (three Green-e certified), prices ranging 6.5 cents 7.0 cents/kWh. Renewable generation today costs substantially less coal nuclear generation prior competition. Yet, $20 stranded cost charge 600 kWh renewable energy residential customer must pay Duquesne service territory concealed value renewable energy, also real price.

MICHAEL FINNEGAN, TERENCE MONMANEY, Times Staff Writers ?????With California mired energy troubles, Mayor Richard Riordan former power chief S. David Freeman trumpet extraordinary fortune Los Angeles: rate hikes blackouts. ?????Yet Riordan Freeman sullied mutual success story waging bitter campaigns discredit other--at first behind scenes public. ?????Pettiness, ingratitude, conflicts interest, overblown claims achievement: back forth two leaders would seem good reason pat back. ?????To Freeman, resigned general manager L.A. Department Water Power become chief energy advisor Gov. Gray Davis, seems Riordan resents high-profile role trying steer California energy crisis. ?????So mayor, Freeman charged, elbowed way energy issues ill-equipped handle taken steps along way could harm environment. ?????\"With due respect, 25 years experience knowledge--and 25 days,\" Freeman said. \"But he\\'s mayor, like say yes everything came with.\" ?????To Riordan, Freeman\\'s efforts fight air pollution given short shrift threat skyrocketing power rates Los Angeles. mayor said Freeman also failed recognize potential conflicts interest city state roles power crisis. scoffed Freeman saying lifted morale DWP. ?????\"Morale terrible him,\" Riordan said. \"I mean, relieved right now.\" ?????The backbiting left associates suspecting clash really egos. City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter sees Riordan Freeman proud, successful men unable say, \"I done without X, Z.\" ?????\"Each used boss taking pleasure recognized boss,\" said. ?????Much conflict taken place private meetings. mayor, Republican multimillionaire, taken pains play dispute Freeman, liberal Democrat Tennessee wears cowboy hat speaks Southern drawl. ?????In interview resignation, Freeman laid conflict point point, often terms bluntly critical mayor. One concerns, Freeman said, Riordan final two months mayor could reverse agency\\'s progress protecting environment. ?????Freeman cited Riordan\\'s plans concerning coal-fired power plants Nevada Utah partly controlled DWP, nation\\'s largest municipal utility. first Mohave Generating Station Laughlin, Nev., plant blamed spreading haze shrouds Grand Canyon. DWP planned sell stake plant, Freeman said Riordan ordered back sale. ?????He described mayor\\'s move sign Riordan appointees board oversees DWP \"completely insensitive fact power plant one environmentally troubling plants West.\" ?????\"I\\'ve worked real hard try build environmental sensitivity DWP policy,\" Freeman said. \"And concerned whether current commissioners mayor sensitivity, might interim basically overturn progress we\\'ve made.\" ?????The plant part Intermountain Power Project central Utah. Riordan proposed building new coal-fired generating unit there, Freeman said objected pollution would cause. ?????In cases, Riordan said striking appropriate balance protecting environment meeting energy needs Los Angeles affordable cost. keeping share Mohave plant expanding Utah plant, Los Angeles avert astronomical price hikes natural gas--and sharp rise ratepayers\\' bills would follow, Riordan said. ?????Natural gas, provides 26% fuel DWP plants, causes less air pollution coal, provides 51%. rest mainly nuclear hydroelectric. Los Angeles averted rate hikes blackouts part DWP relies less natural gas California power providers. ?????\"I favor clean air natural gas, point we\\'re going destroy economy Los Angeles,\" Riordan said. ?????On Mohave plant, Riordan questioned benefit selling city\\'s share buyer would simply continue running it. ?????\"It\\'s still going coal-driven,\" said. \"How selling help environment?\" ?????The tension two built steadily state power crisis worsened. charismatic DWP chief drawing favorable news coverage stories L.A. dodged crisis, Riordan DWP commissioners began view \"too big britches,\" Freeman said. ?????The conflict reached peak April 17, day Freeman resigned become governor\\'s advisor. DWP board president, Kenneth T. Lombard, said mayor told commissioners day \"it made sense release immediately.\" ?????\"All doing, frankly, release responsibilities, whatever time needed clean office fine us,\" Lombard said. ?????From Riordan\\'s standpoint, Freeman needed stripped authority right away potential conflict interest: city utility sells surplus power state, Freeman would sides sales. ?????Freeman, voluntarily bowed DWP meeting state power crisis earlier day, outraged sudden release, part denied chance say goodbye agency employees. interview, called conflict interest assertion \"complete malarkey.\" ?????\"The insinuation done anything less protect interests city Los Angeles bordering slanderous, considering I\\'ve accomplished here,\" said. ?????Brian D\\'Arcy, heads union local represents 6,000 DWP employees, agreed Riordan commissioners \"kind ran here. David summarily jettisoned without even howdy-do absolutely tacky,\" D\\'Arcy said. ?????Riordan said Freeman deserves \"an A-plus\" work DWP. mayor conceded knew nothing Freeman done \"to hurt Los Angeles.\" But, added, \"when conflict interest, act anything happens.\" ?????Freeman long bridled oversight DWP, mayor, agency\\'s board City Council. 1998, called City Charter amendments consolidate authority independent board directors. proposal went nowhere. ?????Freeman\\'s concerns echoed report released Monday.

ISOs RTOs worry transmission, price commodity transmitting. Winning issue critical RTOs proposed throughout country meet Order 2000 obligations. Also, Enron needs really go FERC abdicating wholesale market authority ISOs, especially ISOs like California dominated state political figures. FERC responsible ensuring reasonable rates, stakeholder Board established state legislation. need argue strongly FERC must take back authority near term utilize administrative procedures impose market changes. Finally, given period time truly \"financially indifferent\" transmission provider Order 2000, Enron must take active role working within Boards current ISOs. good example way Dan Allegretti works within NE-ISO. Boards ISOs fundamentally political organizations. representatives must take time get know people key issues arise, able influence decisions.
