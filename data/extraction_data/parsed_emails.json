As\npart of our free trade agenda, we are committed to ensuring that American\nindustry and American workers can compete on a level playing field. That is\nwhy, today, I am announcing my intent to launch an initiative to respond to\nthe challenges facing the U.S. steel industry. This initiative will be\ndesigned to restore market forces to world steel markets and eliminate the\npractices that harm our steel industry and its workers.\n\nThe U.S. steel industry has been affected by a 50-year legacy of foreign\ngovernment intervention in the market and direct financial support of their\nsteel industries. The result has been significant excess capacity,\ninefficient production, and a glut of steel on world markets.\n\nMy decision to pursue this initiative comes after extensive consultations by\nMembers of the Cabinet with our industry, our steelworkers, and interested\nMembers of Congress. We have discussed the challenges facing U.S. steel\nmanufacturers, and we understand that we have a critical stake in a healthy\nU.S. steel industry.\n\nThus, I intend to take the following steps. First, I am directing the United\nStates Trade Representative, in cooperation with the Secretary of Commerce\nand Secretary of the Treasury, to initiate negotiations with our trading\npartners seeking the near-term elimination of inefficient excess capacity in\nthe steel industry worldwide, in a manner consistent with applicable U.S.\nlaws.\n\nSecond, I am directing the U.S. Trade Representative, together with the\nSecretaries of Commerce and the Treasury, to initiate negotiations on the\nrules that will govern steel trade in the future and eliminate the underlying\nmarket-distorting subsidies that led to the current conditions in the first\nplace. Absent strict disciplines barring government support, direct or\nindirect, for inefficient steel-making capacity, the problems confronting the\nU.S. steel industry and the steel industry worldwide will only recur.\n\nWe see these negotiations and the goal of restoring market forces as being in\nour interest and in the interest of our trading partners and their steel\nindustries. That is why we would like to work cooperatively with our trading\npartners in pursuing this initiative.\n\nThird, I am directing the U.S. Trade Representative to request the initiation\nof an investigation of injury to the United States industry by the\nInternational Trade Commission under section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974.\nThis action is consistent with our WTO obligations.\n\nThis three-part strategy, coupled with further restructuring of the U.S.\nindustry, should help the industry meet the challenges it faces. I look\nforward to working together with the industry, the steelworkers, Congress,\nand our international trading partners in support of this important\ninitiative.\n\nContact: White House Press Office, 202-456-2580",

The CEC significantly underestimates the outages that may occur this summer.  They estimate in their 5,000 MW supply deficit for the summer that expected outages will be around 3,000MW.  However, November and December saw significantly higher outage levels.  (7,265 MWs) The FERC has investigated these outages and found no improprieties- just that the plants are overtaxed from running at higher than normal capacities.\n\n2.  There are a lot of uncertainties surrounding the 1,244 MWs of projected supply from rerating/restarting existing thermal and renewable projects.  It is very unclear how much of this will be able to come on line by this summer, if at all.  As evidenced by the e-mail I sent out this morning, local communities may be very opposed to restarting shut down units.  In addition, these units are likely to be uneconomical.\n\n3.  In the existing resource pool, there are roughly 1,430 MWs of peaking or other generation units that are running up against their operating hour limitations from air quality regulations.  The Governor has ordered the local air quality districts to address these restrictions,  We are beginning to seem some movement; however, the US EPA has yet to weigh in on these relaxed standards.\n\n4.  The distributed generation/back-up generation capacity to make up some of the shortfall is still an unknown.  While there has been some relaxing of the limitations on run hours for back-up generation at \"essential public services\" the increase in DG is expected from \"clean\" sources, not diesel emergency generators.\n\n5.  The CEC is doing everything it can to get 50+ MW peaking units on-line by this summer.  They are promising a 21-day permit application approval process and are offering to pay half of the cost of offsets, for \"clean\" sources of generation in critical areas.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or need additional information.\n\n\n\nCEC's Summer Forecasted Peak Demand - Resource Balance:\n\n\n\nList of Peakers running into their operating hour limitations:\n\n\n\nAlso available in hard copy format only:\n(please e-mail me your fax number if you'd like a copy)\n\nTable 1:  Fully Executed CA ISO Summer Reliability Agreements (the ISO Peaking Facilities)\nTable 2:  Summer 2001 Supply Options - Renewables Construction Status Summary\nTable 3:  Summer 2001 Supply Options - Rerate of Non-CEC Projects\nTable 4:  Summer 2001 Supply Options - CEC Rerate Status Summary\nTable 5:  Idle Biomass Plants Potentially Capable of Restart\nMary Schoen\nEnvironmental Strategies\nEnron Corp\n713-345-7422",

    "body": "Ho ho ho, we're around to that most  wonderful time of the year---NEON leaders retreat time!\n\nI know that  this time of year is extremely  hectic, and that it's tough to think about anything past the holidays, but life  does go on past the week of December 25 through January 1, and that's what I'd  like you to think about for a minute.\n\nOn the calender that I handed out at the beginning  of the fall semester, the retreat was scheduled for the weekend of January  5-6.  But because of a youth ministers conference that Brad and Dustin are  connected with that week, we're going to change the date to the following  weekend, January 12-13.  Now comes the part you need to think  about.\n\nI think we all agree that it's important for us to  get together and have some time to recharge our batteries before we get to far  into the spring semester, but it can be a lot of trouble and difficult  for us to get away without kids, etc.  So, Brad came up with a potential  alternative for how we can get together on that weekend, and then you can let me  know which you prefer.\n\nThe first option would be to have a  retreat similar to what we've done the past several years.  This year  we could go to the Heartland Country Inn (www.heartlandcountryinn.com )  outside of Brenham.  It's a nice place, where we'd have a 13-bedroom  and a 5-bedroom house side by side.  It's in the country, real relaxing,  but also close to Brenham and only about one hour and 15 minutes from  here.  We can golf, shop in the antique and craft stores in Brenham, eat  dinner together at the ranch, and spend time with each other.  We'd meet on  Saturday, and then return on Sunday morning, just like what we've done in the  past.\n\nThe second option would be to stay here in  Houston, have dinner together at a nice restaurant, and then have dessert  and a time for visiting and recharging at one of our homes on that Saturday  evening.  This might be easier, but the trade off would be that we wouldn't  have as much time together.  I'll let you decide.\n\nEmail me back with what would be your preference,  and of course if you're available on that weekend.  The democratic process  will prevail--majority vote will rule!  Let me hear from you as soon as  possible, preferably by the end of the weekend.  And if the vote doesn't go  your way, no complaining allowed (like I tend to do!)\n\nHave a great weekend, great golf, great fishing,  great shopping, or whatever makes you happy!\n\nBobby",

She is to\nmeet with Dave Forster and Mark Taylor on Friday, July 13th at 9am.

John said that the interest coming from the Hill is broader than\nthe platform alone and reflects in many ways a lack of understanding of the\nbenefits of what we do in this area.

In Portland, we proposed to handle business email related to the\n> topics in your preservation letter by instructing employees not to delete\n> any email sent or received for 24 hours.  Email that is personal and does\n> not relate to the business topics you have identified can be kept,\n> discarded etc. at the employee's pleasure.  Each day there is a backup\n> made that will capture the email in those employees mailboxes.  After 24\n> hours, each employee is free to manage their email box as they deem\n> appropriate to the business needs (e.g. keep, discard).  From our\n> conversation, I understand that you agree that this is an acceptable\n> procedure.\n>\n> 2. With respect to the hard drives on individual computers, you would\n> like to get an organizational chart for Portland that would enable us to\n> discuss 6-12 individual's computers that would be copied using ProQuest\n> Drive Image Pro 4.0.  In addition, there may be some other individuals\n> that you would like to have us use a software product called Robocopy to\n> copy files from their hard drives onto the network.  Until we figure out\n> which computers to copy etc. we will not begin this process.  We discussed\n> that because of the holiday period, it may not be practical to get this\n> started until after the new year.\n>\n> 3. Outside of Portland, we have proposed making a snapshot backup along\n> business function lines reasonably called for by the subject matter of\n> your request.  We propose not to backup any other business units or\n> functions.  On a going forward basis, those business functions that\n> related to the subject matter of your request would be instructed not to\n> delete business email.\n>\n> 4. We believe that relevant database  backups have been and will\n> continue to be made and preserved.\n>\n> 5. When an employee runs out of hard disk space on their computer, it\n> is an acceptable practice to copy files form their hard disk to the\n> network (where they will be backed up) and then delete those copied files\n> to make sufficient work space for the employee to work.\n>\n> 6. For EES, I explained that their IT services are outsourced so we do\n> not have as detailed information immediately available.\n>\n> As I mentioned on the phone, all of these discussions and efforts being\n> made are done without waiving any objections that any of the Enron\n> entities may have to your request including scope, burden, jurisdiction,\n> relevance, privilege, privacy, vagueness etc. and Enron specifically\n> reserves each and every right and objection it or its employees may have.\n>\n> Please let me know if your general understanding of our conversation is\n> different than the above.\n>\n> Thanks\n> Gary\n\n=======================================================\nThis email message is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may\ncontain confidential and privileged information.

Karin and Jim are anxious to give me a refresher course on\nbabysitting skills.  I told them that when my niece is old enough to\nunderstand the command \"Go find your shoes and I'll help you put them on,\"\nI'll be happy to take her off their hands for a weekend!  I too am in no rush\nto have kids.  While my boyfriend is a great guy and loves children, somehow\nI just can't imagine him hanging around the house helping with diapers!\n\nI am so glad you're enjoying Tampa.  Picking up and moving can be a great\nthing sometimes.  I will never regret leaving Austin for Houston.  There is\njust so much here I enjoy doing and my social life is a whole lot better.\nThe job is absolutely crazy.  If you ever watch \"ER,\" that is usually what my\nday looks like, only without all the blood!  Here at Enron Gas Pipeline Group\nI work as the only lawyer for a very busy commercial team.  We sit in an open\nwork area and it is chaotic every day.  But it's a good crash course in\nbusiness for me, and my clients are wonderful.\n\nDo take some study breaks and keep in touch!  E-mail is a wonderful thing.\n\nTime to hit the tennis courts.\n\nLove,\nSusan\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Brian Scott\" <brianscott67@hotmail.com> on 05/10/2000 06:25:06 PM\nTo: Susan.Scott@enron.com\ncc:\n\nSubject:\n\n\nSusan,\n\nHi, how are you doing? I got your e-mail address from Aunt Sheila. I had\nearlier gotten her e-mail address from my Dad and sent her an e-mail after\nhearing about Karin giving birth. So how about that! Are you excited about\nbeing an Aunt? I can accept being an uncle much more than being a dad. I am\nin no hurry to have kids. Actually, I am in no hurry to get married. I think\nI would be  good dad, although I would have to settle down a bit. But that\nwon't happen anytime soon, as I am enjoying the Tampa area too much. I moved\ndown here last August and am loving it.\n\nI just got done taking the CPA exam and am scheduled to take the FL Bar exam\nin July. So I will not be enjoying FL too much for the next few months. I\njust thought I would drop you a line and see how you are doing. How is\nHouston? Are you still enjoying it there? How's the job? Have you made\npartner yet? Have you seen much of Grayson since her birth? Well enough ?'s,\nI have to go. Let me know how you are doing! Take care.\n\nYour cousin,\n\nBrian\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com",

I suggest a\nfew coordination efforts before we submit the filing:\n\nFirst, EPMI is making the same filing amending its tariff and code of\nconduct, so we should submit the filings on the same day.\n\nSecond, it has been suggested that we call someone at FERC (perhaps Kevin\nMadden) before we make the filing.  We made a similar call to Kevin before we\nstarting using EnronOnline for pipeline capacity, and he seemed to appreciate\nit.  Also, by calling ahead of time, we can answer any questions FERC may\nhave about the filing.  I suggest that we (Enron) make the filing since we've\nhad contact with FERC in the past about EnronOnline.\n\nWe're preparing the EPMI filing now, but it should be ready to go tomorrow,\nso hopefully we can make the call and file tomorrow if this works for\neveryone else's schedule.\n\nSarah",

The following\ndevelopments indicate that the legislation is still very much in play, but\nour primary concerns are making sure efforts going forward remain under\ncontrol and preventing the passage of legislation that goes too far.\n\nDevelopments:\n\nHouse Republican leadership is not interested in pursuing the legislation any\nfurther, either through regular procedures or as an attachment to\nappropriations, \"omnibus\" or other must-pass measures.   They are somewhat\nangry at the industry for not being able to fight off advances made by Reps.\nDingell and Oberstar, who were able to persuade enough Democrats to vote\nagainst the Senate bill so that it fell short of the 2/3 needed for passage\nunder suspension of the rules.\n\nSenate bill sponsors/supporters are extremely angry at House Democrats for\nkilling the Senate legislation, and at the White House/DOT for not strongly\npromoting the Senate bill (which they previously had supported) and reigning\nin House Democrats.   Senator Patty Murray called the White House and\nexpressed her concern, which prompted a series of meetings between staff for\nSenate and House Democrats and the White House to discuss a solution.\n\nIn these meetings, House Democrats have proposed adding several provisions\nfrom the Dingell/Oberstar legislation to the Senate bill and moving that\npackage on an omnibus or appropriations bill.   Sources close to Rep. Dingell\nindicate that they really do not want any bill at all, and are merely keeping\nup the pressure in an effort to see if they can get the Senate or industry to\naccept tougher provisions.\n\nSenate Democrats (including Murray, Bingaman, and Breaux) are not accepting\nany possible amendments to the original Senate bill, and are opposed to\nchanging the Senate bill at all.   However, Senator Murray and Republican\nSenator Slade Gorton (who has a tough election) both want to continue to\npursue the Senate bill (unamended) as a rider to an omnibus/appropriations\nbill.\n\nThe White House is looking to cover itself from a poor performance in the\nHouse, and is considering drafting an executive order that could be issued if\nno legislation passes at all.  It is unclear what could or would be contained\nin such an order, but the White House is indicating to Senate staff that it\nwould be more like the Senate bill than the House bill.  We are working with\nsources close to the White House to confirm their strategy.\n\nStrategy going forward:\n\nUpon hearing that some industry associations were on Capitol Hill discussing\n\"what industry could live with\" in terms of provisions added to the Senate\nbill, I insisted (along with El Paso and others) that we not take such an\napproach, but rather remain consistent in our approach -- we support the\nSenate bill and only the Senate bill.   It was approved unanimously in the\nSenate and by 60% of the House, and if anything moves forward on an\nomnibus/appropriations bill, it should be the Senate bill.  Consistent with\nwhat our Senate friends are doing, we should not even recognize the\nDingell/Oberstar legislation as a serious proposal, nor start accepting\npieces of it as a compromise.\n\nWe will be shoring up support for our position of \"if anything moves forward,\nit should be the Senate bill only\" with Senate supporters and leadership in\nthe House and Senate.  We will also be working to thank the 51 Democrats who\nsupported us in the House, and make sure they have any cover they need in\ncase their vote becomes an issue.   In support of Senator Gorton's election\ntroubles, we will be working to try to get media placement of op-eds that\nsupport the efforts he has waged and make sure the House Democrats shoulder\nthe blame for the bill's defeat.  In particular, we are hopeful that Senator\nMcCain (who has been passionate about this issue) will write op-eds that can\nbe placed to support Gorton and others in tough races who supported the\nSenate bill.\n\nCongress' state of confusion over omnibus/appropriations bills and last\nminute politics causes the legislative activity to be extremely fluid and\nsubject to change rapidly, so we will have no real certainty until the\nsession is over (which now could be as late as October 20).\n\nI will keep you posted as changes and developments occur.\n\nJeff",

    "body": "Enron may have to pay the CAISO $86 million in erroneous imbalance energy charges due to an EES data submission error.  The CAISO would then pay us the money back on June 19th.  I have already discussed this with a few people and am documenting a basic summary for those people who will have to get involved over the next few days if the CAISO board determines that we have to pay the money.\n\nHere is the summary:\n\nEES submitted meter data to EPMI in kWh rather than MWh for one or more accounts for March CAISO activity.\nThis made EES appear to have underscheduled their load in March by a large amount.  The charges associated with this underscheduling total approximately $86 million.\nEES has subsequently submitted the proper data which has been forwarded to the CAISO.\nCAISO staff is fully aware of the error and understands that we don't owe them $86 million.  However, the tariff states that we should do a preliminary settlement on the data that was submitted and then a final settlement using the accurate data.\nPer the tariff, we would owe them $86 million on Thursday May 31st at 10:00 AM PPT.  They would then refund the money to us on June 19th when Final Settlement payments go out.\nThe CAISO staff is taking two proposals to the CAISO Board today.  The Board could elect to do either of these, or strictly adhere to the tariff.  The first option is to allow us to re-submit our preliminary meter data with the right data.  The second option would be to pay them the $86 million but to keep it in some sort of escrow account until June 19th when they would pay it back.\n\nLet's hope for the best with the CAISO board meeting today.  I'll will let everyone know what the outcome is and then we can formulate a plan.",

We are proceeding with the kick-off of the permit amendment, and will be\nusing a combination of both the MCN and Calumet N2 unit data.  Per my phone\nmessage, it will take about a week or two to prepare the amendment at a cost\nup to $10,000 US, and then eight weeks to get the amendment.  We should be\nable to commence site work without the amendment, to the point of completing\nfoundations, based on previous discussions with the Municipality, County and\nOntario Ministry of Envir..\nEven though this work is not in our $35 MM US original DASH budget, we are\nplanning to proceed with this unless you've got a problem with it.\n2.  NEPCO have preliminarily re-worked the schedule now on the N1\ndisassembly, move and install, and the N2 installation.  They believe they\nneed to get on site by the third week in June to begin site clearing in order\nto initiate foundation work by mid July.  Between June 15 and July 15 they\nwould do the foundation design - this should be on the generous side given\nthat we had done some foundation design last fall, and with MCN at least have\nsome of the N2 foundation work already done by ABB.\nWhether it's June 21 or 30 to start the site clearing, the schedule is\ngetting tight.\n\nRe capital cost estimate:\n3.  NEPCO is able to complete the revised capital cost estimate on the N1/N2\ncase by June 9th at the latest (they're looking at moving it up to the 5th or\n6th if they work the weekend).  They have a problem at the moment as they are\nmoving offices over this weekend and will lose about 4 days.  They will have\na revised estimate on the N1 case by the end of next week - it looks today\nlike the cost savings for no acceleration and winter work and being able to\nbarge the units versus railing them, will all be worth at least $2 MM US.\nI'm assuming we would take the capital costs estimate into our DASH as soon\nas the estimate is ready and go for approval, so that we can meet schedule -\nI'm not sure where you stand on the \"roll-up\" approval on Moore, Pastoria and\nLas Vegas if the latter two don't go into Genco.\nMeanwhile, progress through RAC on the DASH continues.\n\nRe N2 units:\n4.  We continue to sort out whether the Calumet units might work from a noise\nand water perspective.  We still haven't seen the MCN/Columbus counter on the\nother units but they claim it's coming.",

Please remind each of your\nrespective groups that this is not an option. Once a customer \"clicks\" on a\ndeal, we have a valid, binding contract.   We lose our audit trail, and we\ncan potentially expose ourselves from a Legal standpoint.   I talked to Mark\nTaylor about this today, and the best option is for Legal to prepare a\ntermination agreement when we agree to let a customer out of a deal.  We\n(Product Control) should be notified immediately if someone is requesting to\nchange an EOL deal.  You can call either myself, Jennifer Denny (x35824),\nFrank Davis (x37235), or Dale Neuner (39746).\n\nCall me if you have any questions.\n\nSheri\nx36557",

He always\ndoes. It is impossible to provide a summary of what he did. Though he\nspeaks from deep preparation, little of what he says is on paper. There\nwill be a tape available of his presentation.\n\nHis topic was fear and how to deal with it. These are certainly\nfearful times.\n\nThis seems to be true on both personal and global levels.\n\nOn my own personal level, the eye surgeon discovered scar tissue\ngrowing on my retina last week. This is a possible side-effect of the\nsurgeries I've had. If this scar tissue can't be dealt with by\nmedication, I'll have to have more eye surgery.\n\nOn our national and global levels, things are out of control.\n\nLet me recommend to you a couple of resources to draw on for these\ntroubling times.\n\nOne is a book that you might want to be reading as we continue to\nspeak about our spiritual journey in light of our present national and\nglobal context. The book is \"When Things Fall Apart: Heart Advice for\nDifficult Times\" by Pema Chodron. One of her points is that the very\neffort to find a safe and secure place is what causes us so much\nsuffering. This book will both challenge and comfort you.\n\nThe other resource is to visit a web site where you can find two\ntalks by Thich Nhat Hanh. One is a sermon he gave at Riverside Church\nright after the 9/11 attacks. The other is an interview he gave\nentitled \"If I Could Talk With Osama Bin Laden.\" You can find all of\nthis at\n\nhttp://www.plumvillage.org\n\nI look forward to seeing you this coming Sunday.\n\nMuch love,\n\nBill Kerley\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nOrdinary Life is a gathering that provides an opportunity to develop an\nenlightened heart and an awakened mind to the reality of the present\nmoment.\n\nThe gathering meets on Sunday mornings at 9:45 am in Fondren Hall at\nSt. Paul's UMC - 5501 South Main, Houston, Texas and is taught by Dr.\nBill Kerley. If you would like more information -\n\nContact\n\nBill Kerley -\n\nE-Mail - Bill@bkspeaks.com\nWeb - www.bkspeaks.com\nVoice - 713-663-7771\nFax - 713-663-6418\nMail - 6300 West Loop South, Suite 480 Bellaire, TX  77401\n==============================\nYou can access the archives of these newsletters by going to\n\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/ordinarylife\n\nYou can add someone you know would be interested in receiving these on-\nline newsletters by sending that information to -\n\nBill@bkspeaks.com\n\nI'll make sure they are added immediately!\n\nOr, they can subscribe themselves by sending an e-mail directly to\n\nOrdinarylife-subscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\nYou can unsubscribe to this newsletter by sending an e-mail to\n\nordinarylife-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n================================\nThe material in this on-line newsletter is copyrighted.
