Subject: Revised Product Description for EOL

This is a follow-up to my e-mail sent yesterday; we are pushing on with this 
new Product Type.

Matt - I need a Sigma Factor.

Deal Type: US East Power Financial Option (Call)
Currency: USD
Country: US
Commodity: East Power
Default U of M: MWh

Please see the attached, and here's how these work:

The easy part is that it's a Call Option. Initially, we will only be offering 
this products as the Seller, meaning the Counterparty will pay the premium 
and ENA pays the Cash Settlement Amount. The option is 'automatically 
exercised' at any time the capacity of certain named nuclear power plants 
goes below 25% (which induces the 'Knock-in Period'). When this happens the 
Cash Settlement Amount will be the total of Notional Quantity X (Hourly PJM 
Floating Price - Strike Price (100 MWh) for each hour during the Knock-in 
Period, and in no event will be greater than USD 4MM. Knock-in Periods may 
commence upon the later of (i) the Effective Date or (ii) the first day a 
Knock-in Event occurs, and will end upon the earlier of (i) 160 Peak hours 
after the commencement of the Event, (ii) the conclusion of the Event, or 
(iiI) the Termination Date; so - you can have multiple Events during the term 
of the transaction, but there will only be one Cash Settlement Amount 
pay-out, which will be 30 days after the last date in the term of the 
transaction.

Per Legal, these transactions will be subject to the GTC and should never be 
subject to any existing Master Agreement.

Specifically, what they are looking at is Nov-Mar fix price Harper purchases that they would then flip to ENA as part of the supply deal.  We should discuss a couple of things before PGL starts this process:

1. How much Harper gas can PGL purchase for Nov-Mar?  I assume that all of the May-Oct '01 has already been purchased by ENA.

2.  What is the basis conversion amount to take fix price Harper and turn it into fix price Chicago?  

3. Should we encourage or discourage these producer lock-ins?  (i.e. do these deals remove a short Harper basis position that ENA doesn't want?)

I'm not sure if PGL is really going to do this, but Raulie would love to get back in the gas buying business.  Let me know when we can get together to discuss.

richard.tomaski@enron.com,"Tomaski, Richard </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=RTOMASK>",FW: EMW liquidation,"Here is my recommendation for the liquidation of EMW.  I would like to transact as early as Monday, so let me know if we need to clear any other hurdles before transacting.

1. Terminate all physical and financial deals between ENA and EMW. (approximate $24.5 million loss to EMW and gain to ENA).  The loss will be removed from EMW's commodity book and recorded in Schedule E. This creates a payable on ENA and a receivable on EMW.  Jeff - can  you help create a document that terminates all transactions with ENA starting in Feb 02?

2. Sell all NSS inventory to PGL at current market price (expected proceeds $24 million in Cash).  I think both parties are agreeable to using the relevant published Gas Daily price on the trade date. EMW will generate transaction confirmation under the master purchase agreement

4. Cash proceeds will be used to pay down I\C payable with ENA.  Cash will be expected on trade date.

5. EMW will continue to show its receivable from ENA from the termination of the hedges and the I\C payable to ENA on its balance sheet.  Accounting is researching if netting these amounts is appropriate.  EMW will carefully monitor these balances.  It is important that the I\C balance not be reduced to an amount less than its receivable to ENA.  Additional income \ cash generated in EMW will be moved to enovate to prevent future I\C pay down.  We hope to have the accounting for Dec activity finished soon.

EMW's books will be left with some demand charge related to the Trunkline deal and may have some other ""sleaving"" transactions such as the ROG transaction.  I will work with Phyllis and Mark to finalize the NSS program Year 2 and calculate a demand credit, if any, to PGL.  I expect EMW to remain dormant, except for the above, until a final decision is made on it status.

Hopefully no food list will be unhappy with this

A CHANGE IN PLANS

Martha Stewart will not be dining with us this Thanksgiving. I'm telling you
in advance, so don't act surprised. Since Ms. Stewart won't be coming, I've
made a few small changes:

Our sidewalk will not be lined with homemade, paper bag luminaries. After a
trial run, it was decided that no matter how cleverly done, rows of flaming
lunch sacks do not have the desired welcoming effect.

The dining table will not be covered with expensive linens, fancy china or
crystal goblets. If possible, we will use dishes that match and everyone
will
get a fork. Since this IS Thanksgiving, we will refrain from using the
plastic Peter Rabbit plate and the Santa napkins from last Christmas.

Our centerpiece will not be the tower of fresh fruit and flowers that I
promised. Instead we will be displaying a hedgehog-like decoration
hand-crafted from the finest construction paper. The artist assures me it is
a turkey.

We will be dining fashionably late. The children will entertain you while
you
wait. I'm sure they will be happy to share every choice comment I have made
regarding Thanksgiving, pilgrims and the turkey hotline. Please remember
that
most of these comments were made at 5:00 AM upon discovering that the turkey
was still hard enough to cut diamonds. As accompaniment to the children's
recital, I will play a recording of tribal drumming. If the children should
mention that I don't own a recording of tribal drumming, or that tribal
drumming sounds suspiciously like a frozen turkey in a clothes dryer, ignore
them. They are lying.

We toyed with the idea of ringing a dainty silver bell to announce the start
of our feast. In the end, we chose to keep our traditional method. We've
also
decided against a formal seating arrangement. When the smoke alarm sounds,
please gather around the table and sit where you like. In the spirit of
harmony, we will ask the children to sit at a separate table. In a separate
room. Next door.

Now I know you have all seen pictures of one person carving a turkey in
front
of a crowd of appreciative onlookers. This will not be happening at our
dinner. For safety reasons, the turkey will be carved in a private ceremony.
I stress ""private"" meaning: Do not, under any circumstances, enter the
kitchen to laugh at me. Do not send small, unsuspecting children to check on
my progress. I have an electric knife. The turkey is unarmed. It stands to
reason that I will eventually win. When I do, we will eat.

Before I forget, there is one last change. Instead of offering a choice
between 12 different scrumptious desserts, we will be serving the
traditional
pumpkin pie, garnished with whipped cream and small fingerprints. You will
still have a choice: take it or leave it.

Martha Stewart will not be dining with us this Thanksgiving. She probably
won't come next year either.

I am thankful.

dinner. For safety reasons, the turkey will be carved in a private ceremony.
I stress ""private"" meaning: Do not, under any circumstances, enter the
kitchen to laugh at me. Do not send small, unsuspecting children to check on
my progress. I have an electric knife. The turkey is unarmed. It stands to
reason that I will eventually win. When I do, we will eat.

Before I forget, there is one last change. Instead of offering a choice
between 12 different scrumptious desserts, we will be serving the
traditional
pumpkin pie, garnished with whipped cream and small fingerprints. You will
still have a choice: take it or leave it.

Martha Stewart will not be dining with us this Thanksgiving. She probably
won't come next year either.

I am thankful.

Hopefully no food list will be unhappy with this

A CHANGE IN PLANS

Martha Stewart will not be dining with us this Thanksgiving. I'm telling you
in advance, so don't act surprised. Since Ms. Stewart won't be coming, I've
made a few small changes:

Our sidewalk will not be lined with homemade, paper bag luminaries. After a
trial run, it was decided that no matter how cleverly done, rows of flaming
lunch sacks do not have the desired welcoming effect.

The dining table will not be covered with expensive linens, fancy china or
crystal goblets. If possible, we will use dishes that match and everyone
will
get a fork. Since this IS Thanksgiving, we will refrain from using the
plastic Peter Rabbit plate and the Santa napkins from last Christmas.

Our centerpiece will not be the tower of fresh fruit and flowers that I
promised. Instead we will be displaying a hedgehog-like decoration
hand-crafted from the finest construction paper. The artist assures me it is
a turkey.

We will be dining fashionably late. The children will entertain you while
you
wait. I'm sure they will be happy to share every choice comment I have made
regarding Thanksgiving, pilgrims and the turkey hotline. Please remember
that
most of these comments were made at 5:00 AM upon discovering that the turkey
was still hard enough to cut diamonds. As accompaniment to the children's
recital, I will play a recording of tribal drumming. If the children should
mention that I don't own a recording of tribal drumming, or that tribal
drumming sounds suspiciously like a frozen turkey in a clothes dryer, ignore
them. They are lying.

We toyed with the idea of ringing a dainty silver bell to announce the start
of our feast. In the end, we chose to keep our traditional method. We've
also
decided against a formal seating arrangement. When the smoke alarm sounds,
please gather around the table and sit where you like. In the spirit of
harmony, we will ask the children to sit at a separate table. In a separate
room. Next door.

Now I know you have all seen pictures of one person carving a turkey in
front
of a crowd of appreciative onlookers. This will not be happening at our
dinner. For safety reasons, the turkey will be carved in a private ceremony.
I stress ""private"" meaning: Do not, under any circumstances, enter the

Guys, attached you will find a final cut on the ENA 2001 expense budget.  
Please review and make any adjustments to your existing plan that are 
appropriate to hit the net ENA target.  In order to stay flat year on year, I 
split the remaining positive variance equally across the groups.  As we had 
discussed earlier, these costs will not be allocated to the business units 
and will be tracked on the ENA income statement below the line and the 
accountability managed by each of you.  All outside variable costs, 
specifically related to specific deals, will be charged to the business units 
eg) outside legal and tax, outside technical expertise, facility costs, 
outside research support, incremental back and mid office support for 
specific asset management deals, specific entertainment, etc.  I look at this 
cost structure as the minimum capacity charge we need to operate our business 
and evaluate/manage our risks.

Wes, can you please  finalize the one page plan (expenses and headcount) for 
each group with these changes.

I was wondering if there is any possibility that your mothers name is Sue and

Ms. Beck,

My name is Ashley Worthing and I just started with Enron about 3 months ago.  
I was wondering if there is any possibility that your mothers name is Sue and 
her maiden name is Worthing?  If I am completely off, I apologize in 
advance...my father, aunt and uncles wanted me to see if I could find you, or 
if this is you.

Thank you,

sally.beck@enron.com,Sally Beck,Fundamental Operating Standards,"Thanks for your comments on the standards.  Our approach in creating a global 
exception reporting mechanism is to start simply and build from there.  Our 
initial cut is to have effective exception reporting on a handful of critical 
standards by the end of this year.  That will be a first, to on a daily basis 
have a view into the exceptions outside the global  standards.  Many of the 
measurements that you mention are great management tools for accessing the 
level of excellence of the services that we are delivering and the competence 
of those that are managing these services.  Some of these may be more 
appropriately contained in a monthly operations report that I have instituted 
within ENA and which we are working to proliferate across all of the 
wholesale merchant services companies.  Give me a call and we can set a time 
to get together for a few minutes and I can review this operating report with 
you.  

We spent some time at our offsite in late October with all operations 
controllers reviewing and discussing these standards.  Shona has taken a stab 
at the format of these exception reports.  It is likely that we will have a 
rep from each of the operating companies participate in the final design of 
these reports, so that all feel as if they own the intended output from these 
reports.  

Yes, we are gleaning this information from those that are responsible for 
these activities.  My purpose is not to use this info to punish or prosecute, 
but instead to use this exception report as a tool to garner resources as 
needed to clear the exceptions.  It is invariably the deals that are 
exceptions in some way that create the problems.  For instance, small power 
deals that were done in Calgary before they had a power book set up.  These 
were ""on the side"" and not captured in total power exposure because they 
didn't have a book to put them in (a discovery during the doorstep review).  
If this goes on the exception report, then we can highjack someone in risk in 
Houston to help Calgary set up a new book, or get IT resources focused 
quickly on any solution that may require their input to fix.  By having a 
prescribed elevation of these exceptions, we should get the appropriate 
attention to correct them.  The spur for making sure that all exceptions are 
appropriately noted, will be that if there is a problem with any deal that 
was an exception (not in the books, no confirm, etc.) and was not included on 
the exception report, that this will be grounds for termination for the 
appropriate operations controller.  I will make sure that as we start this 
reporting process that this is well understood.  The other impetus will be 
that during doorstep reviews the operational activities will be gauged 
against these standards.  The AA internal audits should also access adherence 
to these.

This is the first time I have seen these - have they been rolled out ?

I would be interested to see the format of the exception reporting that 
attaches to these standards that you mentioned - did you have anything 
particular in mind ?

I had a few of my own ideas for some diagnostic measures of the extent to 
which these standards are being adhered to - see what you think:

Transactions are recorded accurately and timely (completeness, accuracy)

Daily report of ""holdovers"" by commodity group (trades not booked in time for 
daily cut - off, including counterparty, volume, price etc)
Report of P&L effect of booking errors as they transpire, including 
responsibility

Daily Management P&L and Position reporting is accurate and timely 
(completeness, accuracy)

Periodic qualitative review by RAC (i.e. Is it sufficient by reference to the 
Risk Management Policy - does it show delta gamma vega as a term structure 
etc....)

NB: the point about ""Reports issued on next day of trading at a commercially 
pre-determined time"" conflicts with the Risk Managemet Policy, which says 
""...before any subsequent trading ocurrs"". I think the diagnostic measure 
should be, for each commodity DPR a report daily of all those signed off as 
final (note I do not neccessarily mean ""officialized"") after the relevant 
market opening time (usuaully 7.30 am)

Timely confirmation and execution of transactions (completeness, accuracy, 
existence)

Monthly report of all unmatched confirmations:

- outstanding inward confirmations (i.e. sent out, not signed) 
- outstanding outward confirmations (i.e deal done, confirm not sent) 
- outstanding mismatched or disputed confirmations

showing deal trade date, start date, commodity, counterparty, MTM value, aged

Settlements with counterparties occurs accurately and timely (non CACS, non 
Dashed deals)

Monthly report of cumulative amounts of all unmatched or unapplied cash:

Unapplied cash by counterparty, in original denomination, including deal 
reference if any
Unmatched amounts by deal, where settled amount differs from maturing forward 
MTM value

One additional thing that ocurred to me was the fact that those responsible 
for supplying the information are also those responsible for the operation 
underlying it in some sense, so the obvious pitfalls of self - assessment 
will come into play here. Perhaps the ""pilot"" report should be put together 
somehow independently.

Subject: Utilicorp

Stephanie and Frank:
Both Susan Bailey and I have spoken with Utilicorp's attorney and here is my 
understanding of where things stand:

1. On Friday, it was my understanding that they submitted their password 
application and that the problem was that the person that they needed to set 
up the sub-user passwords was not in the office.  My understanding is that he 
will be in on Tuesday and that is when they are going to try to set up those 
accounts.  Does that require them to send any paperwork to us?

2. Once the sub-user accounts are set up, then we need to pick a date for the 
Transfer Agreement to become effective.  Since we are changing the date from 
June 16th, this will require someone from Utilicorp to initial the change and 
their attorney wasn't sure when that will happen.  Once the new date is 
picked and initialed, then we can begin trading under Utilicorp's name, but 
nothing should be done until before then.  Either Susan or I will let you 
know when that date is.

steven.kean@enron.com,Steven J Kean,Re: 2001 budget,"I do support the change.  Let me know what I can do to help.  You are 
correct: this is the way we handle regulatory counsel in other regions, 
particularly the US.  What Derrick and I have agreed with regard to counsel 
selection is:  gov't/reg affairs picks the counsel we want to use and he 
retains a veto, which has rarely if ever been exercised.  Once we have 
retained counsel we will use that counsel on other regulatory projects unless 
the legal department starts to have a problem with the firm (eg because they 
represent someone against us in litigation).  Again, I don't recall this ever 
being an issue.  It seems to work:  outside counsel gets the message that we 
will look dimly on any firm that squares off against us and we select the 
most qualified counsel on our issues.

Subject: 2001 budget

You should be receiving today a copy of my draft budget proposed for Enron 
Europe for 2001.  I understand from Nick that they are doing their own budget 
for Enron Japan, which I will see only after the fact.

MOST IMPORTANTLY, you will see that I am budgetting to pay a substantial sum 
for legal fees.  I will be proposing to John Sherriff, Michael Brown (our new 
COO and former General Counsel, which will make my proposal doubly 
problematic), and to Mark Evans (current General Counsel) that I pay/manage 
our outside regulatory counsel.  We can discuss (rather than do a lengthy 
e-mail), but having this function managed by Legal (and Houston/Jim Derrick 
rejecting our choice of counsel in important cases), is increasingly a 
problem.  I believe this will mirror what you do in the USA, e.g., Dan 
Watkiss, and hope that I can count on your support for this change.  thansk

You should be receiving today a copy of my draft budget proposed for Enron 
Europe for 2001.  I understand from Nick that they are doing their own budget 
for Enron Japan, which I will see only after the fact.

MOST IMPORTANTLY, you will see that I am budgetting to pay a substantial sum 
for legal fees.  I will be proposing to John Sherriff, Michael Brown (our new 
COO and former General Counsel, which will make my proposal doubly 
problematic), and to Mark Evans (current General Counsel) that I pay/manage 
our outside regulatory counsel.  We can discuss (rather than do a lengthy 
e-mail), but having this function managed by Legal (and Houston/Jim Derrick 
rejecting our choice of counsel in important cases), is increasingly a 
problem.  I believe this will mirror what you do in the USA, e.g., Dan 
Watkiss, and hope that I can count on your support for this change.  thansk

Ken Lay Visit. Following discussions with the Prime Minister's office and a 
quick check with venues 31 October is firming up as the preferred date for a 
meeting with the Prime Minister and an office opening by the PM. 

Jeff Skilling Visit. The Nikkei and the Tokyo University have now made the 
decision to invite Mr Skilling to give the key note address at the symposium 
on 26 November in Tokyo. As mentioned, the symposium is the most prestigious 
conference on IT in Japan.

While the conference itself receives significant media attention, the 
President of Nikkei has offered to interview Mr Skilling. This honour is 
usually reserved for Heads of State. The interview will be featured on the 
front page of the Nikkei and picked up by other major media services.

Ken Lay Visit. Balancing the need to push out the arrangement of high level 
meetings as far as possible with the desire to have a meeting with Prime 
Minister Mori prior to the US Presidential election, the week commencing 30 
October would be the optimum time for a visit by Mr Lay. PM Mori is generally 
available in that week. We will get a preferred time from the PM's chief 
secretary first thing tomorrow morning Tokyo time. 

Jeff Skilling Visit. The boards of Nikkei and Tokyo University Institute of 
Advanced Studies have yet to make a decision on the key note speaker for the 
one day invitation only seminar to be held on 26 October. As mentioned, the 
boards will choose between the chairman of Cisco and Jeff Skilling. The 
conference is focused on the IT revolution and an invitation only event for 
approximately 600 of Japan's corporate leaders.

The speaking panel and topics for discussion will be developed around the key 
note speaker. If Mr Skilling were to give the key note speech, it is likely 
that key senior Government Ministers would be asked to present at the 
seminar. 

Following the Prime Minister's commitment at the Okinawa summit of 
US$15billion expenditure in the region on IT infrastructure and education, 
Japan's focus on e-commerce is almost reaching fever pitch. There will be 
significant interest in the conference from senior levels of Government and 
the business community. Further, as you would expect with the involvement of 
the Nikkei, there is typically significant media coverage associated with the 
key note speaker's presentation.

Company Divisions and have developed the following game plan to resolve the 
division issue with respect to this counterparty:

The following entities exist in GCP:

1.  Koch Hydrocarbon Co. (GCP #36680):  We would like this entity to remain 
OPEN and to be renamed ""Koch Industries, Inc., acting through its Koch 
Hydrocarbon Company Division"". 
2.  Koch Hydrocarbon Company (GCP #57853):  We would like all future trading 
with this entity SUSPENDED.  There appears to be one trade under this entity 
and this trade should me moved to GCP 36680.
3.  Koch Hydrocarbons Inc. (GCP #26197):  We would like all future trading 
with this entity SUSPENDED.  There appear to be no trades under this entity.

With respect to the current financial trading being done by Koch Industries, 
Inc. (GCP #126) (not under a master agreement), I spoke to the Legal 
Department at Koch and we will be entering into a side letter agreement with 
Koch that will put all financial trades done by Koch Industries, Inc. under 
the existing ISDA Master Agreement we have with Koch Industries, Inc. acting 
through its Koch Hydrocarbon Company Division.  I will let you all know when 
such side letter agreement has been executed.

transmission (I had no idea, silly me).  Further, even if we have a master in

under a GTC.  My records show they have come thru before through EOL and 
Legal shut down for power (Credit has them open). 
EMISSIONS:  They would also like to transact SO2, and want to get a master in

transmission (I had no idea, silly me).  Further, even if we have a master in 
place with them, I don't know whether we would want to transact under it or 
under a GTC.  My records show they have come thru before through EOL and 
Legal shut down for power (Credit has them open). 
EMISSIONS:  They would also like to transact SO2, and want to get a master in 
place with  us.  I told her I would have one of the emissions lawyers talk to 
her (they are already open w/Legal & Credit to trade emissions).
MASTER USER CHANGE:  She already has a password set up with us and would like 
to change the master user.",179,3046

Yeh , the amazing thing about having a tied Bush/Gore election ( I think

Per our discussion yesterday Marty I've been asked to check on two issues
regarding Enron.  First an attorney in our Philadelphia office has been asked
to do some work for Wiser Oil Company as follows.  Wiser is acquiring the
stock of a Canadian Corporation called Invasion Energy.  Enron Canada owns
about 50% of the stock of Invasion.  Wiser has Canadian counsel who has asked
us to work with them.  Enron Canada is represented by Bennett Jones LLP.
Although we don't do any work for Enron Canada, I thought I needed to see if
anyone at Enron had any problems with Reed Smith getting involved in this
transaction as stated above.  I'm told an answer to this one ASAP would be
nice.

Second question is a little more confusing.  An attorney in our New York 
office
has been asked by a broker for Enron Global Services to get involved in
negotiating a financial guarantee insurance agreement about providing
insurance coverage for Winterthur International.  We would be representing
Winterthur in the transaction.  I can get more information if needed.

Subject: PG&E Advice Letter Implementing Surcharge


Something I forgot to mention in the last e-mail regarding PG&E's Advice
Letter implementing the surcharge is that they  appear to have gone a step
beyond what the Commission directed them to do.

The Commission directed them to create a balancing account to track the
revenues obtained from the surcharge (just in case, in the unlikely event,
they have to refund them).  PG&E created the balancing account for this
purpose but also stated that they would transfer (on a monthly basis) any
ongoing procurement costs which were not recovered through the TRA (i.e.,
from ongoing revenues) to this new balancing account as well.  It is unclear
what PG&E's purpose is for doing such except  maybe to stop the
undercollection in the TRA from getting any bigger and hope that they will
have a better shot of recovering undercollections in the new balancing
account.

Again let us know if you want us to comment on the advice letter with
respect to this issue and the direct access issue mentioned in the previous
e-mail.  Energy Division only has five business days to review the Advice
Filing -- so any comments/protest of the filing must go in early next week.

		 Subject: Status of efforts to fix Direct Access ban in ABX -1


    We are now engaged with a large coalition of customer groups
committed to passing language in a Bowen bill (a spot bill SBX - 27 has
been introduced for this purpose by Bowen) to fix the language in ABX -1
which permits a ban on new direct access agreements.  We have committed
to Bowen to get her staff a first attempt at draft language by close of
business tomorrow.  The attachment to this email is a draft which has
been discussed by the customers group coalition.  We would like to have
input on this language by 11 am PST tomorrow if at all possible.  Please
email responses to Mike Day at mday@gmssr.com or calling 415-279-0702.

The aim of the bill is to provide specific direction to the DWR and CPUC
so that they cannot use their discretion to make customer choice more
difficult.  In addition to the language in the draft attachment, several
other issues were discussed on the call.  Please comment on these as
well if you can.

1. In sub para. (c) it was felt we should carefully define the stranded
costs DWR might face so they have to show actual damage from a customer
leaving.  CMA proposed defining these ""actual costs"" as ""the costs that
DWR cannot reasonably avoid until one or more of its long term power
contracts expire.""   Thus, if the load electing direct access fits
within the DWR short term purchases, there are no stranded costs and no
exit fee.

2. Should there a limitation on the number of times a customer can
switch into and out of the bundled service portfolio?  CMA and other
customers were willing to live with a limit of one switch a year.

3.  Should customers be required to give DWR notice of their desire to
return or the expiration of their direct access deal?  There was some
willingness to do this, balanced against a desire to not be too specific
or to do DWR's work for them.

4.  The large customers were very uncomfortable with having the
definition between small customers who could switch without restriction
and large customers who could not be 500 Kw.  That is the number the
core/noncore advocates are pushing as a dividing line.  The group would
prefer that the limit be 100 Kw, which is the limitation adopted in AB
265, the  SDG&E rate cap bill from the end of last session.  Thus the
100 kW figure has a legislative connection, but still allows a fair
number of commercial customers to have unlimited flexibility to switch.


This is detailed and prescriptive language, but the customer group
parties were strongly convinced that any effort to craft regulations at
the CPUC would be much worse, leading to the desire to limit the CPUC's
discretion with specific language.  At this stage, after hearing that
CPUC Comm. Wood hoped to use ABX -1 to end direct access ( a comment
made to NEV or Greenmountain), we tend to agree.  We will get a better
negotiated result at the legislature than at the CPUC.

Thanks in advance for your fast turnaround on this.  Mike Day

costs DWR might face so they have to show actual damage from a customer
leaving.  CMA proposed defining these ""actual costs"" as ""the costs that
DWR cannot reasonably avoid until one or more of its long term power
contracts expire.""   Thus, if the load electing direct access fits
within the DWR short term purchases, there are no stranded costs and no
exit fee.

2. Should there a limitation on the number of times a customer can
switch into and out of the bundled service portfolio?  CMA and other
customers were willing to live with a limit of one switch a year.

3.  Should customers be required to give DWR notice of their desire to
return or the expiration of their direct access deal?  There was some
willingness to do this, balanced against a desire to not be too specific
or to do DWR's work for them.

4.  The large customers were very uncomfortable with having the
definition between small customers who could switch without restriction
and large customers who could not be 500 Kw.  That is the number the
core/noncore advocates are pushing as a dividing line.  The group would
prefer that the limit be 100 Kw, which is the limitation adopted in AB
265, the  SDG&E rate cap bill from the end of last session.  Thus the
100 kW figure has a legislative connection, but still allows a fair
number of commercial customers to have unlimited flexibility to switch.


This is detailed and prescriptive language, but the customer group
parties were strongly convinced that any effort to craft regulations at
the CPUC would be much worse, leading to the desire to limit the CPUC's
discretion with specific language.  At this stage, after hearing that
CPUC Comm. Wood hoped to use ABX -1 to end direct access ( a comment
made to NEV or Greenmountain), we tend to agree.  We will get a better
negotiated result at the legislature than at the CPUC.

Thanks in advance for your fast turnaround on this.  Mike Day

Subject: Non payment by PG&E for Negative Charges


As you are aware, PG&E has stopped paying all ESPs (who do consolidated
billing) as well as all Direct Access customers who are billed by PG&E the
amounts owed as a result of negative charges accumulating due to high PX
prices.  We have spoken with the representatives of a number of ESPs --
Green Mountain, NewWest, APS Energy -- who are highly concerned about this
and are considering action in the form of a complaint filed at the CPUC. We
do not know, however, whether/when they will do such, and whether any relief
afforded would be sufficient to cover other ESPs not named as complainants.
Recognizing that Enron has relationships with PG&E on may different fronts,
we realize that it may not be in its best interest to file a complaint
against PG&E at this time.  We will not proceed on any form of official
complaint against PG&E, until we hear differently from you

Subject: Re: California PUC Decision Info/Update  

From the most recent information we have, the most likely outcome appears to 
be the following:

As we've discussed this week, the administration and the utilities continue 
to have a very difficult time reaching agreement on 1) how much of the 
undercollection the IOUs should absorb and how much consumers should absorb 
and 2) how big the rate increase should be to manage the IOUs cash 
flow/credit  problems (governor wants 10%, IOUs want at least 20%). 
It remains likely that the Commission will rule today on relaxing regulations 
to make it easier for the IOUs to enter into longer-term contracts w/out 
getting 2nd and 3rd guessed by the Commission.
It is likely that the Commission will signal strongly that it will not let 
the IOUs go bankrupt but will only go so far as to outline its plan for 
considering and implementing a ""rate stabilization"" plan in Q1 2001.

That said, the stakes are very high and things could change dramatically 
between now and 2 PM PST.  Just talked to two SVPs with PG&E and Edison and 
they said that they don't know what the Commission will do at 2.
